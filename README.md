# Project Aim
The goal of this project was to create a Deep Q-Learning agent which solves the Open AI Gym Environment "Cart-pole", where a pole must be balanced on a cart that can move left and right. The task is considered successfully completed if the pole is balanced for longer than two seconds.

The intention was to teach myself DQNs and become a better programmer. It was successful in clarifying my understanding of DQNs, and I successfully reached the two second mark! Also to note: this was a project I coded in 2022, but adding it now to Github. 

## Details

Though Open AI gym has become Gymnasium, I decided to continue with just the gym library, as that was the simplest option and this is just for documenting my progress/projects.

I have a youtube series which goes through this code in detail and explains it line by line. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdnC_AsIWc&t=100s&ab_channel=JeremiNuer
