# Project Aim
The goal of this project was to create a Deep Q-Learning agent which solves the Open AI Gym Environment "Cart-pole", where a pole must be balanced on a cart that can move left and right. The task is considered successfully completed if the pole is balanced for longer than two seconds.

The intention was to teach myself DQNs and become a better programmer. It was successful in clarifying my understanding of DQNs, and I successfully reached the two second mark!

There are a couple functions of note I'll describe quickly.
